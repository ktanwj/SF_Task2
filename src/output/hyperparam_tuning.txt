 
!code abstracted from https://github.com/achyutb6/grid-search-cv/blob/master/SciKitLab2.py
I included a portion of the grid search cv code from the above github link and added my own hyperparameters to tune.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script would ingest the processed data and perform grid-search-cv based on the tuned_parameters defined. 

I will be performing hyperparameter tuning on 4 different algorithm:
1. Decision tree
2. KNeighbours
3. RandomForest
4. XGBoost

The best performing hyperparameters will then be pasted in the model_config.toml for further use.

Note: By running python ./model_tuning.py > ../../output/hyperparam_tuning.txt on terminal, the output would be saved under the output folder named: hyperparam_tuning.txt.
Perhaps future iteration could include a method that would do so automatically.
